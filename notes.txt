Todo
	Make game.h and game.cpp to handle the actual game mechanics
		*** Create an algorithm to only allow valid inputs
			ex) Don't allow 'ㄳ' as a initial consonant,
			    but make it possible to input 'ㄱ' then 'ㅅ' in cases such as '악성' etc
		- Box animations (when Enter is pressed)
			Decrease height value for both boxes and texts
			Change box color when height is 0
			Increase height value back to original
		- Make sure vowels aren't input-able when there is no consonant to add it with

	Make a pop-up system
		- Make two SDL_Textures, one for the pop-up screen and one for the game screen
		- Make the actual pop-up on the first one;
		  Close icon at top right
		  Other stuff for whatever the pop-up is about
		- copy the first one to the center of the second one,
		  which should have a translucent gray color to dim the stuff behind the pop-up
		- After all above, render it on screen
	Do stuff with menu icons
	Tooltip support / full keyboard support / random typing support
	Additional support to unfortunate individiuals whose shift keys don't work lol
	---
	Current problems:
		"Unused" letters (ex. 긙) are shown empty as the font doesn't support such letters

	Design window icons

	make a readme for whatever idk stuff (im stuff)

	Bigger screen resolution support (idk why but will do) << use a multiplier of 1.5
		- Implement a multiplier for every drawn sprite, and save the multiplier in settings.txt
		(Currently saves resolution 400x650)
		- Change SDL drawing functions to F versions so it allows subpixel precision

Misc notes
	Figure out whether or not to hardcode the answers

Screen
	Screen size : 400x650 (default), maybe consider 600x975 as an option
	boxes start at 35, 166
	each box is 60x60
	gaps are 10 pixels wide

	Blank box / Wrong letter : 58, 58, 60 (edge of blank box has a thickness of 2 pixels)
	Wrong spot : 174, 159, 77
	Correct spot : 101, 139, 85
