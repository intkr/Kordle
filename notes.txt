Todo
	Make game.h and game.cpp to handle the actual game mechanics
		-
	Make a pop-up system
		- Make two SDL_Textures, one for the pop-up screen and one for the game screen
		- Make the actual pop-up on the first one;
		  Close icon at top right
		  Other stuff for whatever the pop-up is about
		- copy the first one to the center of the second one,
		  which should have a translucent gray color to dim the stuff behind the pop-up
		- After all above, render it on screen
	Do stuff with menu icons
	---
	Design window icons
	Bigger screen resolution support (idk why but will do) << use a multiplier of 1.5
